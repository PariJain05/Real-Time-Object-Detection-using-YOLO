# Real-Time Object Detection for Visually Impaired
This project is developed as a part of our Academic Mini Project under the Department of Information Science and Engineering.
This project aims to assist visually impaired individuals by detecting surrounding objects in real-time using "YOLOv8"
and announcing the detected objects through "text-to-speech".

## Features
- "Real-Time Object Detection" using YOLOv8.
- "Text-to-Speech Integration" to announce detected objects.
- "Excludes Person detection" to reduce redundant outputs.
- "User-Friendly GUI" using TKinter for starting/stopping detection.

## Tech Stack
- "Language:" Python
- "Libraries:" OpenCV, pyttsx3, ultraalytics(YOLOv8), TKinter
- "Hardware:" Laptop/PC with Webcam.
